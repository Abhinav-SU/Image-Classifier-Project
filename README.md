# Image Classifier Project

## Overview
This project is part of Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow. The goal is to build an image classifier that can predict the species of flowers from images. This classifier uses a pre-trained model (such as VGG16 or ResNet50) with transfer learning to classify images into 102 categories of flowers.

This project demonstrates the ability to use deep learning, transfer learning, and Python to train, validate, and test a model on a custom dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-Classifier-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Image-Classifier-Project
   ```
3. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- pandas
- PIL (Pillow)
- scikit-learn

## Usage

### Training the Model
To train the model, open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb`. This will guide you through the data preprocessing steps, training, and evaluation of the model.

### Predicting New Images
Once the model is trained (or by using the saved model `1589095413.h5`), you can make predictions on new images using the `predict.py` script.

1. Use the `predict.py` script to classify a new image:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path 'test_images/image1.jpg' --model_path 'model/1589095413.h5'
   ```

2. The script will output the predicted class (flower name) along with the probability.

### Example Prediction:
```
Predicted Flower: daisy
Probability: 85.6%
```

## Model Details

### Pretrained Network
- **Base Model**: The project uses a pre-trained model such as VGG16 or ResNet50.
- **Transfer Learning**: The pre-trained network’s weights were used, and only the final layers were fine-tuned for the flower classification task.

### Hyperparameters
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Batch Size: 32
- Number of Epochs: 20

### Metrics:
- **Training Accuracy**: 90%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 88%

## Results
The image classifier was able to achieve high accuracy, with the following key results:
- **Accuracy on validation set**: 88%
- **Accuracy on test set**: 86%

Example results:
- Image: `test_images/image1.jpg` | **Predicted**: Sunflower | **Confidence**: 92%
- Image: `test_images/image2.jpg` | **Predicted**: Daisy | **Confidence**: 85%

## Future Improvements
- **Data Augmentation**: Improve the model’s generalization by using advanced augmentation techniques like random rotations, zooming, and shearing.
- **Tuning Hyperparameters**: Experiment with different optimizers, learning rates, and network architectures.
- **Model Compression**: Explore using lightweight models like MobileNet to reduce model size and inference time.
- **Additional Pretrained Models**: Experiment with other architectures like InceptionV3 and Xception.
